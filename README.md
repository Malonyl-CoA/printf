# printf project

This is  collaboration project for ALX Software engineering program. In this project we made our customized printf function, which does pretty much the same as the original printf function, but with added functionalities like printing binary from scratch. We have revolved around and made use of man printf 3, to get how different specifiers are handled, to come up with this customized function named \_printf.
